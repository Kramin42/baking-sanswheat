Wheat/Gluten Free Bread
=======================

A soft gluten free bread with minimal collapsing and good flavour.
Makes two 10x20 cm^2 loaves or equivalent surface area (400 cm^2).

### Ingredients
* 300 mL warm water
* 1 packet (7 grams/ 2 teaspoons) instant/rapid rise yeast
* 110 grams corn starch
* 110 grams tapioca starch
* 160 grams millet flour
* 3 Tbsp sugar
* 1/2 Tbsp xanthan gum
* 1/2 Tbsp teaspoons guar gum
* 1 teaspoon table salt
* 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
* 3 large eggs (should come to around 150 grams)
* 3 Tbsp oil
* 1 Tbsp lemon juice (or 1/2 Tbsp vinegar)

### Instructions
1. Mix water and yeast in a bowl and allow to stand for five minutes.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine millet flour, tapioca starch, sugar, xanthan gum, guar gum, salt, and baking powder. Whisk to combine. 
3. Fit the stand mixer with the flat paddle attachment. Add the yeast mixture, eggs, oil, and vinegar. Mix on medium speed until smooth. The dough should be a thick batter.
4. Spray your loaf tin(s) with oil and spread the dough evenly inside. Cover and stand in a warm place until it has doubled in size (30 to 60 mins).
5. Bake at 180°C for about 40 mins, or until the internal temperature reaches 100°C.
6. Remove bread from the oven and allow to cool for two minutes. Transfer bread to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.

### Notes
* The Guar gum can be substituted for Xanthan and vice versa (i.e. just use 1 Tbsp of one) but the results may not be quite as good.
* You can also make buns with this recipe, although they are a little difficult to shape. The mixture should hold its shape while rising/baking.
